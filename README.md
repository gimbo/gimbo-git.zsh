# Andy's git zsh config

This is basically a subset of the [oh-my-zsh git plugin
aliases](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/plugins/git/git.plugin.zsh),
plus some of my own aliases, plus a few handy functions.

You can source this directly, or (recommended) use one of the many zsh plugin
managers around (my preference: [zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen)).

See also my [fzf.zsh plugin](https://github.com/gimbo/fzf.zsh), which contains a
handy command called `sb` to quickly switch between git branches using a fancy
fuzzy-matching menu driven by the awesome
[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).
